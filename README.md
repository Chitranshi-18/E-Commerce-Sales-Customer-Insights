# E-Commerce-Sales & Customer-Insights

---

## 📘 Overview



This project analyzes an e-commerce transactional dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify high-value customers, and evaluate sales performance using Python and Power BI. The focus is on business metrics such as AOV, CLV, RFM segmentation, and revenue concentration patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** : (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data cleaning, EDA, customer metrics
- **Power BI** : Interactive dashboards and KPI visualization
- **Statistics (Descriptive)**: Trend and distribution analysis


---
## 🗂️ Dataset Structure

- **Source:** Kaggle – E-Commerce Sales Dataset
- **Type**: Single transactional dataset containing: 
    - Invoice ID
    - Customer ID
    - Product details
    - Quantity & price
    - Transaction date



---
## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning (Python):**
  - Removed cancelled and invalid transactions
  - Converted date columns to datetime format
  - Created revenue feature (Quantity × UnitPrice)

2. **Sales & Customer Metrics**
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
  - Purchase frequency per customer

3. **RFM Analysis**
  - Calculated **Recency, Frequency, Monetary** metrics
  - Segmented customers into RFM score groups
  - Identified high-value and at-risk customer segments

4. **Revenue Concentration Analysis**
  - Applied Pareto analysis
  - Found that ~20–30% of customers contribute ~65–70% of total revenue

5. **Power BI Dashboard**
  - Sales KPIs (Revenue, Orders, AOV)
  - Customer segmentation (RFM & CLV)
  - Revenue trends over time
  - Top customers and contribution analysis

## 📊 Key KPIs
- **Total Revenue**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
- **Purchase Frequency**
- **RFM Segments**

---

## 🔍 Insights Generated
- A small percentage of customers generate the majority of revenue (Pareto effect)
- High-frequency, high-monetary customers show strong retention behavior
- RFM segmentation helps identify churn-risk customers for targeted engagement


---

## 📝 Future Improvements
  - Add cohort analysis for retention tracking
  - Implement customer clustering using K-Means
  - Predict customer churn using basic ML models
