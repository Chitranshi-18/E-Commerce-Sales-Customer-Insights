\# E-Commerce-Sales \& Customer-Insights



---



\## 📘 Overview







This project analyzes an e-commerce transactional dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify high-value customers, and evaluate sales performance using Python and Power BI. The focus is on business metrics such as AOV, CLV, RFM segmentation, and revenue concentration patterns.

\## 🛠️ Tools \& Technologies



\- \*\*Python\*\* : (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data cleaning, EDA, customer metrics

\- \*\*Power BI\*\* : Interactive dashboards and KPI visualization

\- \*\*Statistics (Descriptive)\*\*: Trend and distribution analysis

\## 🗂️ Dataset Structure



\- \*\*Source:\*\* Kaggle – E-Commerce Sales Dataset

\- \*\*Type\*\*: Single transactional dataset containing: 

&nbsp;   - Invoice ID

&nbsp;   - Customer ID

&nbsp;   - Product details

&nbsp;   - Quantity \& price

&nbsp;   - Transaction date

\## 🚀 Project Workflow



1\. \*\*Data Cleaning (Python):\*\*

&nbsp;     - Removed cancelled and invalid transactions

&nbsp;     - Converted date columns to datetime format

&nbsp;     - Created revenue feature (Quantity × UnitPrice)



2\. \*\*Sales \& Customer Metrics\*\*

&nbsp;     - Average Order Value (AOV)

&nbsp;     - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

&nbsp;     - Purchase frequency per customer



3\. \*\*RFM Analysis\*\*

&nbsp;     - Calculated \*\*Recency, Frequency, Monetary\*\* metrics

&nbsp;     - Segmented customers into RFM score groups

&nbsp;     - Identified high-value and at-risk customer segments



4\. \*\*Revenue Concentration Analysis\*\*

&nbsp;     - Applied Pareto analysis

&nbsp;     - Found that ~20–30% of customers contribute ~65–70% of total revenue



5\. \*\*Power BI Dashboard\*\*

&nbsp;     - Sales KPIs (Revenue, Orders, AOV)

&nbsp;     - Customer segmentation (RFM \& CLV)

&nbsp;     - Revenue trends over time

&nbsp;     - Top customers and contribution analysis

\## 📊 Key KPIs

\- \*\*Total Revenue\*\*

\- \*\*Average Order Value (AOV)\*\*

\- \*\*Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\*\*

\- \*\*Purchase Frequency\*\*

\- \*\*RFM Segments\*\*

\## 🔍 Insights Generated

\- A small percentage of customers generate the majority of revenue (Pareto effect)

\- High-frequency, high-monetary customers show strong retention behavior

\- RFM segmentation helps identify churn-risk customers for targeted engagement

\## 📝 Future Improvements

&nbsp; - Add cohort analysis for retention tracking

&nbsp; - Implement customer clustering using K-Means

&nbsp; - Predict customer churn using basic ML models
